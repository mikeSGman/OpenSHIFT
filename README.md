OpenSHIFTStuff
==============
Essentially, this is a store point for my ever changing adaptation of the publically available OpenShift Stuff.  My systems will call this (pre hardened, and VLAN flopped) to use the installer located here.  

I hope to mitigate issues having to maintain the file in multiple locations by using this instead.

If you find this useful, fork and issue pull requests.

Thanks and enjoy!!
